"""
Large-Scale Graph Analysis for Subgraph Detection in Large Networks

This module contains functions for analyzing large-scale networks efficiently.

Techniques Used:
- Graph partitioning
- Parallel processing
- Scalable algorithms

Libraries/Tools:
- NetworkX
- Dask
- GraphX (via PySpark)

Note: This module assumes that the preprocessed graph is already stored in a NetworkX format.
